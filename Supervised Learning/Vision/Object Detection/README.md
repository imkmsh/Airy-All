# YOLOv3

- 2015년에 발표된 You Only Look Once
- 당시에는 Faster-R-CNN이 가장 좋은 성능을 내고 있었음
- 처음으로 One-shot-detection 방법 고안
- 이전까진 Two-shot-detection, 실시간성 부족

# Faster-R-CNN

Faster-RCNN is composed of 3 neural networks — Feature Network, Region Proposal Network (RPN), Detection Network

## Feature Network
- well known pre-trained image classification network such as VGG
- generate good features from the images
- output of this network maintains the the shape and structure of the original image

## RPN
- a simple network with a 3 convolutional layers
- one common layer which feeds into a two layers — one for classification and the other for bounding box regression
- generate a number of bounding boxes called Region of Interests (ROIs) that has high probability of containing any object
- output from this network is a number of bounding boxes identified by the pixel co-ordinates of two diagonal corners, and a value(1, 0, or -1, indicating whether an object is in the bounding box or not or the box can be ignored respectively)

### Training

- a number of bounding boxes are generated by a mechanism called anchor boxes
- every ‘pixel’ of the feature image is considered an anchor
- Each anchor corresponds to a larger set of squares of pixel in the original image

- anchors are positioned uniformly across both dimensions of the reshaped image
- input that is required from the feature generation layer to generate anchor boxes is the shape of the tensor, not the full feature tensor itself
- a number of rectangular boxes of different shapes and sizes are generated centered on each anchor
- usually 9 boxes are generated per anchor (3 sizes x 3 shapes)

- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is used in the fist step of reduction
- NMS removes boxes that overlaps with other boxes that has higher scores ( scores are unnormalized probabilities , e.g. before softmax is applied to normalize)
- about 2000 boxes are extracted during training phase
- they are further reduced through sampling to about 256 before entering the Detection Network  


- to generate labels for RPN classification, IOU of all the bounding boxes against all the ground truth boxes are taken
- the IOUs are used to label the 256 ROIs as foreground and background, and ignored
- these labels are then used to calculate the cross-entropy loss, after first removing the ignored (-1) class boxes


- Bounding box regression: the RPN also tries to tighten the center and the size of the anchor boxes around the target
- for this to happen, targets needs to be generated, and losses needs to be calculated for back propagation
- Target delta vector for the center: the distance vector from the center of the ground truth box to the anchor box is taken and normalized to the size of the anchor box
- The size target is the log of the ratio of size of each dimension of the ground truth over anchor box
- the loss is calculated by using an expression called Smooth L1 Loss


- the regular L1 loss ( e.g. the norm or absolute value) is not differentiable at 0
- smooth L1 Loss overcomes this by using L2 loss near 0
- the extent of L2 loss is tuned by a parameter called sigma

~~~
if abs(d) < 1 / sigma**2
loss = (d * sigma)**2 / 2
else
loss = abs(d) — 1 / (2 * sigma**2)
~~~

- the losses are back propagated the usual way to train RPN
- RPN can be trained by itself, or jointly with the Detection Network

## Detection Network
- input from both the Feature Network and RPN
- generates the final class and bounding box
- composed of 4 Fully Connected or Dense layers
- 2 stacked common layers shared by a classification layer and a bounding box regression layer
- to classify only the inside of the bounding boxes, the features are cropped according to the bounding boxes
