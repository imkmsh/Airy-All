# YOLOv3

- 2015년에 발표된 You Only Look Once
- 당시에는 Faster-R-CNN이 가장 좋은 성능을 내고 있었음
- 처음으로 One-shot-detection 방법 고안
- 이전까진 Two-shot-detection, 실시간성 부족

# Faster-R-CNN

Faster-RCNN is composed of 3 neural networks — Feature Network, Region Proposal Network (RPN), Detection Network

## Feature Network
- well known pre-trained image classification network such as VGG
- generate good features from the images
- output of this network maintains the the shape and structure of the original image

## RPN
- a simple network with a 3 convolutional layers
- one common layer which feeds into a two layers — one for classification and the other for bounding box regression
- generate a number of bounding boxes called Region of Interests (ROIs) that has high probability of containing any object
- output from this network is a number of bounding boxes identified by the pixel co-ordinates of two diagonal corners, and a value (1, 0, or -1, indicating whether an object is in the bounding box or not or the box can be ignored respectively)

### training

- a number of bounding boxes are generated by a mechanism called anchor boxes
- every ‘pixel’ of the feature image is considered an anchor

## Detection Network
- input from both the Feature Network and RPN
- generates the final class and bounding box
- composed of 4 Fully Connected or Dense layers
- 2 stacked common layers shared by a classification layer and a bounding box regression layer
- to classify only the inside of the bounding boxes, the features are cropped according to the bounding boxes
